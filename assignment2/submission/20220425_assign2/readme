Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough? Explain.

No. I don't think so. As StrCopy recieves an char pointer pcDest as a parameter, we cannot use sizeof() to compare the memory area, specified 
by the two strings, inside the StrCopy function. Doing this will result in undefined behavior. We would probably have to check the destination
memory area is big enough before calling StrCopy function.

Extra Credit: I used only pointer notation to implement string functions.
