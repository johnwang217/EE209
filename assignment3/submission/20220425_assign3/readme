Implemented hash table expansion inside RegisterCustomer()

customer_manager using array to store user info is easy and simple to implement, but struggles when you try to search for a particuler element
as you have to linearly iterate through every element until you find it. This results in poor performance when the array has large amounts of
elements. On the other hand, customer_manager using hash tables excels at searching and often provides constant time O(1) when looking up for
some element. Similarly, inserting and deleting elements are also fast as it only needs to access one index. However, all the advantages above
are only valid if the hash function doesn't produce many collisions. If it does, hash table becomes inefficient. Therefore, using appropriate 
hash function is very important. Also, implementation of hash table can be complex compared to arrays.
